#### Description
In the era of information technology, humans tend to develop better and more convenient lifestyles. Wireless technology has already become an important application
that is usually integrated into a wide range of devices and other technologies. The enhancements provided by the wireless technology give ease of control to the users.
Nowadays, almost all electronic devices are equipped with wireless technology. This fact shows the necessity and benefits provided by this technology. Therefore, we intend to
develop an application which is called ChooseEat.
This application was written in Python using the Django framework to prepare an application that gives a realistic feel to users.
To work upon the code, we used Visual Studio Code as a text editor and compiler.
#### What is ChooseEat ?
The ChooseEat website allows users to order food from local restaurants or food cooperatives. As with ordering consumer goods online, many of these also allow
customers to maintain accounts with them to make ordering easier in the future. A customer will search for a favorite restaurant, usually filtered via type of cuisine and
choose from available items, and place the order.
